## Course Overview

The software development process is examined from initial requirements analysis to operations and maintenance. Student teams develop a software system from requirements to delivery, using disciplined techniques. This is an intense classâ€”late assignments will not be accepted. Keep up!

## Course Objectives

- Work within a team to ideate, define, and implement an MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
- Develop understanding of the Software Development Lifecycle and the tools that are required to work within a team environment.
- Execute the implementation of a software product using software engineering principles. We will bucket the work in three high level phases: Conceptual, Foundational, Feature Development.
- Operate within your team using an Agile framework to plan and execute tasks.
- Delivery a final presentation of your software product, along with corresponding deliverables: Product Documentation, Source Code / Builds / Pipelines, Recorded demo and presentation.
