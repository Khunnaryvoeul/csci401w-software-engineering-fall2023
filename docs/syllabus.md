## Course Overview

This 16-week course examines the software development process from the initial requirements analysis to operations and maintenance. Student teams will actively participate in developing a software system from its inception to delivery, employing disciplined techniques representative of the industry's best practices.

## Course Objectives

- Collaborate within a team to brainstorm, define, and implement an MVP (Minimal Viable Product).
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Agile Software Development Lifecycle and the tools essential for team-based projects.
- Strategically implement a software product by adhering to established software engineering principles. Our work will be categorized into three overarching phases: Conceptual, Foundational, and Feature Development.
- Effectively utilize the Agile framework for planning and task execution within teams.
- Conclude the course by delivering a detailed presentation of your software product, supported by necessary deliverables such as Product Documentation, Source Code, Builds, Pipelines, and a recorded demonstration.
