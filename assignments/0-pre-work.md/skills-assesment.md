## Introduction

Dear students,

Welcome to **CSCI 401W Software Engineering**! As we embark on this journey of understanding and implementing the software development process, I aim to create a supportive and collaborative learning environment for all. This skills matrix is not a test but a tool to help me get to know you better. Your responses will provide valuable insights into your strengths, experiences, and preferences.

Remember, there's no "right" or "wrong" answer. It's completely okay to feel inexperienced in several areas. This is all about self-perception. I will use this information to group you into compatible teams, aiming for a mix of skills and strengths in each group, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience for everyone.
